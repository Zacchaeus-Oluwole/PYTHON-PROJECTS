# tmax: tmax is the maximum time horizon for which the safety measures are to be computed. In the context of the algorithm
#       tmax represents the number of time steps for which the backward iteration is performed.

# n: n is the number of nodes in the graph

# S: Safety value S(t)(u,v)
# S: S is a three-dimensional matrix of size tmax x n x n and represents the dynamic safety matrix.
#    It stores the shortest path distances between nodes at each time step, 
#    where S[t][i][j] represents the shortest path distance from node i to node j at time t.

# C: Dynamic cost of the arcs
# C: C is a three-dimensional matrix of size tmax x n x n and represents the cost matrix.
#    It stores the edge weights between nodes at each time step,
#    where C[t][i][j] represents the weight of the edge from node i to node j at time t.


# Successor: Successor (u, v) = w is defined as the node w succeeding u on the safety path between u and v.
#            By convention Successor (t ) (u, v) = âˆ’1 when u=v.
# Successor: Successor is a three-dimensional matrix of size tmax x n x n and represents the successor matrix. 
#            It stores the successor nodes on the shortest path from each node to the destination node at each time step, 
#            where Successor[t][i][j] represents the successor node of node i on the shortest path from node i to node j at time t.

# The function DynamicSafety(tmax, n, C, S, Successor) is an algorithm that computes the dynamic safety and successor matrices for a given graph and time horizon. 
# It takes tmax, n, C, S, and Successor as input arguments and updates S and Successor during a backward iteration over the time steps.

# The C matrix is used to compute the shortest path distances between nodes in the graph using the Dijkstra's algorithm, 
# and the computed distances are stored in S. 
# The Successor matrix is updated during the computation of S to store the successor nodes on the shortest path. 
# The backward iteration over time steps then updates the S and Successor matrices to compute the dynamic safety 
# and successor matrices for the given graph and time horizon.
